              resulting reads are usually longer than the RNA and therefore
              contain parts of the 3' adapter. That adapter must be found and
              removed error-tolerantly from each read before read mapping.
              Previous solutions are either hard to use or do not offer
              required features, in particular support for color space data. As
              an easy to use alternative, we developed the command-line tool
              cutadapt, which supports 454, Illumina and SOLiD (color space)

              useful features. Cutadapt, including its MIT-licensed source

              flexibility, correct handling of paired-end data and high

              efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle
              paired-end data. RESULTS: The value of NGS read preprocessing is
              demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks.
              Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least
              competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by
              other tools, in all scenarios tested. AVAILABILITY AND

  title    = "Evaluation of {microRNA} alignment techniques",
  author   = "Ziemann, Mark and Kaspi, Antony and El-Osta, Assam",
  abstract = "Genomic alignment of small RNA (smRNA) sequences such as
              microRNAs poses considerable challenges due to their short length
              (∼21 nucleotides [nt]) as well as the large size and complexity
              of plant and animal genomes. While several tools have been
              developed for high-throughput mapping of longer mRNA-seq reads
              (>30 nt), there are few that are specifically designed for
              mapping of smRNA reads including microRNAs. The accuracy of these
              mappers has not been systematically determined in the case of
              smRNA-seq. In addition, it is unknown whether these aligners
              accurately map smRNA reads containing sequence errors and
              polymorphisms. By using simulated read sets, we determine the
              alignment sensitivity and accuracy of 16 short-read mappers and
              quantify their robustness to mismatches, indels, and nontemplated
              nucleotide additions. These were explored in the context of a
              plant genome (Oryza sativa, ∼500 Mbp) and a mammalian genome
              (Homo sapiens, ∼3.1 Gbp). Analysis of simulated and real
              smRNA-seq data demonstrates that mapper selection impacts
              differential expression results and interpretation. These results
              will inform on best practice for smRNA mapping and enable more
              accurate smRNA detection and quantification of expression and RNA

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the
              new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast
              and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash
              table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is
              accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from
              a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped
              alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for
              alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The
              speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to
              the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We
              implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read
              alignment package that is based on backward search with
              Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short
              sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the
              human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both
              base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and
              color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both
              simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x
              faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition,
              BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence
              Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream
              analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source

  abstract = "The past two decades of microRNA (miRNA) research has solidified
              the role of these small non-coding RNAs as key regulators of many
              biological processes and promising biomarkers for disease. The
              concurrent development in high-throughput profiling technology
              has further advanced our understanding of the impact of their
              dysregulation on a global scale. Currently, next-generation
              sequencing is the platform of choice for the discovery and
              quantification of miRNAs. Despite this, there is no clear
              consensus on how the data should be preprocessed before
              conducting downstream analyses. Often overlooked, data
              preprocessing is an essential step in data analysis: the presence
              of unreliable features and noise can affect the conclusions drawn
              from downstream analyses. Using a spike-in dilution study, we
              evaluated the effects of several general-purpose aligners (BWA,
              Bowtie, Bowtie 2 and Novoalign), and normalization methods
              (counts-per-million, total count scaling, upper quartile scaling,
